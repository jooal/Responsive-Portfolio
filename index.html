                            I grew up in Potomac, MD where I attended the Bullis School. I graduated from the University of Miami in 2015 where I studied Psychology and Economics. Originally, I was on the pre-med track but decided to explore other career options shortly after graduating. I currently am interested in startups, digital marketing, and blockchain. I enjoy reading startup forums and learning about people's failures and successes in the industry and their journey of being an entrepreneur. I have a million company and product ideas! I had pitched an idea for a blockchain based smart contract solution to an accelerator, however, due to my lack of coding skills I was unable to show them a viable product. I hope my coding skills will give me the ability to create and further enhance my digital marketing skills. My career goals are to either do digital marketing for a big brand or start my own company.

I love to travel and enjoy anything on the water, whether it's snorkeling or being on a boat. My favorte food is sushi. I have a Hound mix named Sadie.
